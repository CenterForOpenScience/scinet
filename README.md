## Scholarly -- Crowd-Sourcing the Academic Citation Graph

### What is Scholarly?

Scholarly is a open source, collaborative project being developed at the Center for Open Science. The primary purpose of Scholarly is to provide the public with a free, open, and comprehensive dataset containing meta-data for academic citations as well as corresponding references. This dataset will allow the public to access, analyze, and distribute academic citation meta-data without restriction.
